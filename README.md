FRB Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides a collection of tools for analyzing the current sample of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).
It includes code for sky mapping, coordinate transformations, statistical tests, null simulations, and multi-domain exploration.

The goal of this project is to offer a unified environment for reproducible FRB data analysis across geometry, frequency, temporal structure, and ensemble statistics.
