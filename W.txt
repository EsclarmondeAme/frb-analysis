geometry of the anisotropy

(draft section for the paper)

1. preferred axis determination

three independent tracers — the cmb hemispherical modulation axis, the frb angular clustering axis, and the terrestrial sidereal-phase “clock” peak — converge to within ≈5–10°, defining a statistically preferred sky direction.
the unified best-fit axis derived from the frb sample is

(l, b) = (159.85°, −0.51°)

jackknife tests, hemisphere splits, and random-axis comparisons confirm that this axis is stable under resampling, with typical shifts 10° for all but the most aggressive sky cuts.

2. radial structure relative to the axis

when frbs are projected onto angular distance θ from the unified axis

a strong, statistically significant radial break appears at
θ ≈ 25°

ΔAIC(real) = 52.6 relative to a constant model

monte carlo null p-value ≪ 1e−4

no corresponding change in DM, width, fluence, or energy across the break

interpretation
the break is geometric rather than physical — a structural change in the angular distribution, not in the frb population properties.

3. evaluation of simple geometric models

we tested multiple candidate shapes

model	result
single cone	disfavored (residual tests show no robust support)
doubletriple cone	improvements vanish after footprint correction
torusring	strongly disfavored (ΔAIC = −23.7; p=1.000)
polar cap	poor fit
radial polynomial	best overall fit (minimum AIC)
broken-power radial	also competitive, capturing the ≈25° break

conclusion
no simple “cone,” “ring,” “torus,” or “cap” geometry describes the sky pattern.
the angular density is better approximated by a smooth radial function with a single structural transition.

4. azimuthal structure

azimuthal symmetry tests (axisymmetry χ², Fourier m-mode analyses, lobe-finder) show

significant non-axisymmetric structure

strongly detected m=1 component

higher modes marginal

peak-map analysis does not favor a fixed number of discrete lobes (p ≈ 0.82)

this indicates “patchiness” or “faceting,” but not a stable polygonal shape (e.g., pyramid, hexagon, square).

5. multipole decomposition

spherical-harmonic reconstruction (ℓ ≤ 15) reveals

a dominant dipole aligned near the unified axis

a significant quadrupole component

additional weaker higher-order contributions

the combination suggests a smooth, axis-aligned gradient plus an extended ridge, not a sharply edged object.

6. 3d anisotropy reconstruction

the full 3d reconstruction shows

anisotropy concentrated along a broad band perpendicular to the axis

no evidence for a closed ring or hollow torus

rather, a broad ridge or wall-like feature

7. combined geometric verdict

putting it together

a real, statistically secure preferred axis

a real radial break at ≈25°

no clean simple shape (coneringtorus)

azimuthal structure present but not periodic

best-fitting model
a smooth radial profile with one transition + mild faceting

in scientific language

the anisotropy resembles a broad, axis-centered ridge or sheet with a radial density transition, rather than a sharply defined geometric object
